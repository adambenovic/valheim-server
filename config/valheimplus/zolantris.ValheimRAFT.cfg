## Cluster rendering efficiently improves how the raft renders. It will offer 50% boost in FPS for larger ships. You can reach upwards of 90 FPS on a 3000 piece ship vs 40-45fps. It does this by combining meshes so editing and damaging these components is a bit more abrupt. WearNTear animations go away, but the items can still be broken. Updates require re-building the meshes affected so this can be a bit heavy, but not as heavy as bounds collider rebuild.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: false
EnableVehicleClusterRendering = false

## Set the number of pieces to render threshold for using cluster rendering. smaller ships will not have cluster rendering apply. Lowest number of items possible is 10 as it's less efficient to run this on smaller vehicles. Recommended range is above 100 and max is 1000 which will significant improve the ship. If you do not want it enable turn off the feature via the key: <EnableVehicleClusterRendering>.

Lowest is the lowest most hull piece will determine the float height, allowing users to easily raise the ship if needed by adding a piece at the lowest point of the ship. Custom allows for setting floatation between -20 and 20
